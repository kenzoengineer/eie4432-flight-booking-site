# Todo

## General

- The way I implemented the admin thing sucks, we either:
  - Don't care users can just change their local storage, and put it there
  - Put it in Context/Global state

*low priority below:*

- Add some links to the footer
- Polish
  - Transitions/animations
- Code cleanup

## Flights

~~- Booking button should take flight id, (_id)~~
~~  - Currently returns undefined~~

## Booking

~~- Fetch data from backend~~
~~- Redirect to payment~~
~~- Handle if they choose a first class seat~~

## Payment

~~- Send a booking request to the backend~~
~~- Feedback to user~~
- Redirect button

## Account

- Fetch previous transactions

## Messaging Queue

- Front end implementation
- Fetch on user login

## Admin > Change Seat Maps

~~- Does pretty much nothing right now~~
~~- Fetch data~~
~~- Front end clicking and saving~~
~~- Connect with endpoint~~

## Finalization

- Record video
- Finish other project requirements (docs, etc.)
- Deployment
  - Vercel most likely
